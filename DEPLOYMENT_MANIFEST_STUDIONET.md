| Publication status |Public source/evidence checkpoint a54a4fde7a6d601de0ef470687e1104e0eb989cc; unchanged canonical file verified byte-for-byte. Later documentation publication is distinct from deployment source commit.|

The immutable deployed source commit is preserved in [canonical Git bundle](deployment/canonical-source.bundle); the checked-in production file matches its SHA256. A later documentation/publication commit is distinct from the deployment source commit. Business protocol/IDs retain EIM-V1-STUDIO; consensus revision, source hash and contract address distinguish the approved safety implementation. [Full manifest](deployment/canonical.json) and [network evidence](ONCHAIN_EVIDENCE.md).

## Superseded diagnostic deployments

Old0x6Dbde095C83a68B7932f7dE80Ba0642043F5Ce03 and intermediate0xbA3F0E8E45caF7665F0532313021Bb1B93b3c6eC are historical diagnostics only. Never use them as a canonical alternative/fallback. Historical receipts/manifests/approved ACR files remain preserved; no migration or redeployment performed in publication.
